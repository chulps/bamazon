# bamazon

This is my "Bamazon" App. It's meant to poorly emulate Amazon using a SQL Database. 

To run this app you will need to install two NPM packages,

1. MySQL
2. Inquirer

To start the app, navigate to "bamazonCustomer.js" and open it in your terminal or command line.

Enter the command 'node bamazonCustomer.js' and enjoy shopping at BAMAZON!
